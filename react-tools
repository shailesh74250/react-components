Some use cases are:
- Data fetching
- Global state management
- UI components
- Schema validation
- Virtualisation
- Working with dates
- Internationalisation
- Charts and visualisations

I have been working with React for more than
4 years now.

I have slowly picked up the libraries that are
both flexible and fit for the right job.

Here's my go-to list of libraries these days:

1. react-router:
For routing in your application

2. reduxjs/toolkit:
For global state management

3. @tanstack/react-query
For data-fetching and caching on the front-end

4. @tanstack/react-table
For building powerful tables and data grids

5. @radix-ui
For primitive components of the app

6. recharts
For building customizable charts and visualizations

7. react-select
For building async dropdowns

8. react-hook-form
For building performant forms

9. classNames
For merging classNames

10. motion
For building smooth animations

11. date-fns
For working with dates
